# PackIt
---
PackIt is a free, open source, C# library for packing data into a byte buffer.

It is designed to be integrated as part of your source code. Intended for use with the Unity game engine.

Most notably, it provides methods of swizzling primitives as quantized values with varrying degrees of lossy precision.

#### Getting started
---
If you are targeting a Unity project, drop the contents of the repository directly into your unity project where-ever you feel it makes sense. Make sure to check out the example scene to get an idea of what this class can do.

If you are not using Unity you only need the 'PackIt/PackIt.cs' file to get started.
